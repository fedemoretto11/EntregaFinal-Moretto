# Super Music Changuito

This project is a fully functional e-commerce application that was developed during the React JS course offered by CoderHouse and led by the instructor Horacio Gutierrez. It is a complete React adaptation of my final project, originally built for the [vanilla JavaScript course.](https://github.com/fedemoretto11/SuperMusicChanguito)
